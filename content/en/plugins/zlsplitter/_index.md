## About

ZL Splitter is a multifunctional audio splitter plugin, which can split the input signal into:

- left/right signal
- mid/side signal
- low/high signal
- transient/steady signal
- peak/steady signal

The routing may look like follows:
```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Input] -->B(ZL Splitter)
    B --> C[Output 1] --> C1(Some Effects) --> E[Full Signal]
    B --> D[Output 2] --> D1(Some Effects) --> E
```

## Installation

Visit [this link](https://github.com/ZL-Audio/ZLSplitter/releases/latest) and download the installer that matches your OS:

- If the file has a `.dmg` extension, it is for macOS (in `VST3` & `AU`).
- If the file has a `.exe` extension, it is for Windows (in `VST3` & `LV2`).
- If the file has a `.zip` extension, it is for Linux (in `VST3` & `LV2`).

For more information, please refer to the [Plugin Installation](../../help/plugin_installation) page.

## User Interface

The user interface consists of a top panel, a left panel, and a right panel.

### Common Components

#### Button

Click the button to switch between the "pressed" and "released" states.

#### Rotary/Horizontal/Vertical Slider

Values can be adjusted by dragging/clicking with the mouse or scrolling the mouse wheel. You can enable mouse wheel fine adjustment with Ctrl/Command.

### Top Panel

___

<p float="left">
  <img src="/images/zlsplitter/zlaudio.svg" width="44pt" />
  <img src="/images/zlsplitter/logo.svg" width="20pt" />
</p>

Double-clicking the icon to open the [UI setting panel](#ui-setting-panel).

___

<p float="left">
  <img src="/images/zlsplitter/arrowlr.svg" width="20pt"/>
</p>

- Press: `Output 1` outputs right/side/high/steady signal; `Output 2` outputs left/mid/low/transient signal.
- Release: `Output 1` outputs left/mid/low/transient signal; `Output 2` outputs right/side/high/steady signal.

Peak/Steady Split

___

### Left Panel

The bottom panel controls the parameters of the currently selected split type, which will change according to the current split type.


#### Left/Right Split

___

**Mix**

The mix portion of left/right signal.

___


#### Mid/Side Split

___

**Mix**

The mix portion of mid/side signal.

___


#### Low/High Split

___

**Mix**

The mix portion of low/high signal.

___


**Filter Structure**

- SVF：state variable structure
- FIR：truncated reversed structure

> When the filter structure is SVF, the filter will change the phase significantly. Under such situation, you should not mix the output with the original signal directly or cascade multiple low/high splitters. If you do need to cascade SVF filters, you may refer to [Cascade SVF Filters](#cascade-svf-filters).

> When the filter structure is FIR, the filter will NOT change the phase. However, it will cause latency, the amount of which depends on the sample rate and the filter slope.

___

**Filter Slope**

There are three slopes: 12 dB/oct, 24 dB/oct and 48 dB/oct.

___


**Cutoff Frequency (Freq)**

___

#### Transient/Steady Split

Unlike Peak/Steady Split, Transient/Steady Split uses a FFT based model to split transient/steady signal. They do not share parameters.

___

**Strength**

When it is 0, no separation occurs.

___

**Balance**


The smaller the balance, the less transient signal and the more steady signal, and vice versa.

___

**Hold**

The larger the hold, the slower the decay of transient signal.

___

**Spectrum Smoothness (Smooth)**

- When it is 0, the different frequencies of the signal are split into transient and steady signals relatively independently.
- When it is 100, the signal is split into transient and steady signals as a whole.

___

#### Peak/Steady Split

Unlike Transient/Steady Split, Peak/Steady Split uses a compressor-like model to split peak/steady signal. They do not share parameters.

____

**Attack**

The larger the attack, the slower the starting of peak signal.

____

**Balance**

The smaller the balance, the less peak signal and the more steady signal, and vice versa.

___

**Hold**

The larger the hold, the slower the decay of peak signal.

___

**Smooth**

The larger the smooth, the less the frequency of the change of peak/steady.

___

### UI Setting Panel

The UI setting panel controls colours, slider operations, etc. Components will be introduced in the order from top to bottom.
___


You can adjust the colour by clicking on the left colour block.

**Text Colour**

**Background Colour**

For better accessibility, please set Text/Background to colours with high contrast.

**Shadow Colour**

**Glow Colour**

**Import Colours**

- import colour settings (`.xml` file)

**Import Controls**

- import control settings (`.xml` file)

___

<p float="left">
  <img src="/images/zlequalizer/save-line.svg" width="18pt"/>
</p>

- Save the current setting.

___

<p float="left">
  <img src="/images/zlequalizer/loop-left-line.svg" width="18pt"/>
</p>

- Load the default settings of some colours.

___

  <img src="/images/zlequalizer/xmark.svg" width="16pt"/>
</p>

- Discard all unsaved settings and close the UI setting panel.

___


## Appendix

### Automation

You can automate all parameters. During automation, Mix and Cutoff Frequency of SVF filters change per sample while the other parameters change per buffer.

### Cascade SVF Filters

    A[Input] --> B1(Cutoff Freq f1)
    B1 --> C[Output 1] --> B2(Cutoff Freq f2) --> O1[Output 1 + Output 2] --> F1[Low]
    B1 --> D[Output 2] --> B3(Cutoff Freq f2) --> O2[Output 1] --> F2[Mid]
    B3 --> O3[Output 2] --> F3[High]
```
